# Bubble sort is similar to insertion sort, but takes at least 2 passes to sort data (nearly sorted data at that)...insertion sort takes about 1

# Key properties:
  # Stable (that is: two keys in the input array with equal values remain in the same order in the output/sorted array).
  # Adaptive, when nearly sorted (that is: if a given number of keys in the input array are presorted, this algorithm can take advantage of the existing order to complete faster)
  # O(1) worst space complexity
  # O(n^2) worst/avg time complexity
  # Î©(n) best time complexity (when nearly sorted)
  # Note the key properties are extremely similar to insertion sort

# super simple testing, see benchmark.rb results
