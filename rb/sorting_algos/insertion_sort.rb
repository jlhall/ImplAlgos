# Very basic sorting method with O(n^2) worst-case time
# Why use? Insertion sort is adaptive (when mostly sorted) and stable, and works well with small problems!!! 

# Key properties:
  # Stable (that is: two keys in the input array with equal values remain in the same order in the output/sorted array).
  # Adaptive, when nearly sorted (that is: if a given number of keys in the input array are presorted, this algorithm can take advantage of the existing order to complete faster)
  # O(1) worst space complexity
  # O(n^2) worst/avg time complexity
  # Î©(n) best time complexity
  # Also note that generally insertion sort has extremely low overhead, so the cost of implementation is minimal/often trivial

# super simple testing, see benchmark.rb results

puts "#{test1}: insertion_sort output matches #sort output."
