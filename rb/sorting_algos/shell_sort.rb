# Shell sort is based off of insertion sort, inheriting its adaptive properties, although it isn't normally as dramatic due to the full loop per increment. Shell sort has low overhead, is simple to implement and has sub-quadratic time complexity, so it may be a decent alternative if the data sorted is not large and is already pre-sorted to some degree.

# Key properties:
  # Not stable (that is: two keys in the input array with equal values do not remain in the same order in the output/sorted array).
  # Adaptive, when nearly sorted (that is: if a given number of keys in the input array are presorted, this algorithm can take advantage of the existing order to complete faster)
  # O(1) worst space complexity
  # O(n^2) worst/avg time complexity
  # Î©(n lg(n)) best time complexity

# super simple testing, see benchmark.rb results
